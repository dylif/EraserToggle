# EraserToggle

A very basic plugin that gives the ability to toggle between the pen and eraser tool in
Xournal++.

Usually, you would be able to do this within Xournal++, but due to an issue with several
drawing tablets, configuring the stylus buttons does nothing. By binding your stylus button(s)
to Ctrl-t in your drawing tablet drivers, you will be able to recover some of this functionality.

For the time being, this plugin only supports toggling between the pen and the eraser.
